# Space Liberators

A fast-paced, 2D space shooter game developed using **Java** and built on core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

This project was developed as a demonstration of applying computer science fundamentals to game development, focusing on robust game mechanics, performance optimization, and modular design.

## 🚀 Features

* **Real-Time Combat:** Integrated real-time collision detection and event-driven mechanics for engaging space battles.
* **High Performance:** Optimized to deliver a smooth **60 FPS experience** during gameplay testing.
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Engineered using OOP principles to ensure **code scalability** and maintainability.
* **Responsive Controls:** Designed modular input systems with responsive keyboard controls to reinforce a user-focused development approach.
* **Enhanced Interactivity:** Features a dynamic environment that enhances user interaction features.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

This project requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) and an IDE that supports Java (like IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code).

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher is recommended.
* **Git** (for cloning the repository).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MohamedYoussef06/Space-Liberators.git](https://github.com/MohamedYoussef06/Space-Liberators.git)
    cd Space-Liberators
    ```

2.  **Open in IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended):**
    * Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    * Select **File > Open** and navigate to the cloned `Space-Liberators` folder.
    * IntelliJ should automatically detect and configure the Java project structure.

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  Ensure the project is correctly configured in your IDE.
2.  Locate the main class file (e.g., `Main.java` or `Game.java`) which contains the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
3.  Run the main class directly from your IDE.

**Gameplay Controls:**
* Controls are based on **responsive keyboard controls**. (Specific keys may be added here if you recall them, e.g., WASD for movement, Spacebar for shooting).
