Do not change the path of the window files, as many sprites rely on this specific path to load correctly. 
If a white screen appears, it likely means the path has been altered. The correct format should be: window/window/Images.
To play the game, please open your IDE like IntellJ and open the folder through your directory:
users ---> Computer Name ---> Location where you downloaded the file -----> Click on Space Liberators and open.

Then through that, you will have opened the folder through intellj. To find the launcher through Intellj, click through these folder:
Space Liberators --> Window --> Window --> Window --> Launcher

ENJOY!

Note: Make sure to unzip the file before opening it through intellj.
Another Note: Make sure when opening files through Intellj directory, you open the second space liberators and not the first main one
